## 🎥What I done
My teammate and I create a 3-5 minutes video blog visit to UTMDigital Open Day. The video include:
- Introduction of your group and the visit
- Overview of the Program/Visit
- Detail presentation on UTMDigital
- Conclusion and Reflection

## 📝Reflection
Through the UTMDigital Open Day and the talk I attended, I have see how IT use in daily life. It also help me understand the relationship between academic learning and industry practice. The talk also show what technology used in UTM. It also gave me insight into potential career paths in IT services management. Last, this assignment improved my video edit skill, interview techniques and how to work effectively with group members.
